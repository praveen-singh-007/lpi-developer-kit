### Evidence 1: Real Response from LPI Tools
My code actively calls the LPI tools by spawning the Node.js server as a subprocess and sending JSON-RPC requests. Here is the actual raw text returned by the `smile_overview` tool when my code calls it, proving the connection works:

> # S.M.I.L.E. — Sustainable Methodology for Impact Lifecycle Enablement
> Benefits-driven digital twin implementation methodology focusing on impact before data.

### Evidence 2: Explainability (Provenance)
Explainability isn't just a feature in my agent, it's structurally forced. The agent prints a dedicated provenance block at the end of every execution so the user knows exactly where the data came from. Here is the exact output:

PROVENANCE (tools used)
[1] smile_overview (no args)
[2] query_knowledge ({"query": "What is SMILE methodology?"})
[3] get_case_studies (no args)

### Evidence 3: Explainability in Action
Explainability is deeply integrated into the LLM's response. When prompted, the agent uses inline citations to trace its logic back to the tools. Here is an example of what it says when asked to explain a recommendation:

**User Question:** "Why do you recommend starting with Reality Emulation?"
**Agent Answer:** "I recommend starting with Reality Emulation because it is the foundational Phase 1 of the SMILE methodology, which focuses on creating a shared reality canvas before investing heavily in sensors **[Tool 1: smile_overview]**. According to the methodology steps, this phase takes days to weeks and helps establish 'where and when' **[Tool 2: get_methodology_step]**. Furthermore, the 'Smart Heating for Municipal Schools' case study shows that skipping this alignment leads to disjointed data silos later on **[Tool 3: get_case_studies]**."
